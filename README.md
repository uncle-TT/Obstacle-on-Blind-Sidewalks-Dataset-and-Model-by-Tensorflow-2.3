# Obstacle-on-Blind-Sidewalks-Dataset-and-Model-by-Tensorflow-2.3
This is an open source project on the deployment of deep learning to embedded microprocessors. The project establishes a data set for obstacle recognition of blind travel environment, and trains a simplified MoblieNet model in TensorFlow. Finally, the binary file of the model is deployed on the UNCLEO-STM32H7A3ZIT-Q development board to realize the function of obstacle detection of blind travel environment.
